* **Problem: Doing the wrong thing** / **Ability: Seeing the big picture** It's easy to lose focus on a big project or even on a small one if you don't focus on what really adds value to your customer. Think twice about every feature, abstraction or technology you are going to add to your project, code or stack. [Say no by default.](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Start_With_No.php)     
* **Problem: Using the wrong tool for the job** / **Ability: Broad knowledge** Developers constantly analyze risks, costs and advantages. Be it software architecture, cloud hosting provider, database backend or even programming language he uses. A true professional should be able propose different approaches to a given problem and critically discuss pros and cons. To achieve this as a developer you will need to have as broad knowledge as possible. Google helps only if you know what to search for.   
* **Problem: Software complexity** / **Ability: Breaking problem down to manageable chunks** Software is complex, but to make thinks worse, it rarely (if ever) gets simpler as times goes by. The ability to break down complex problems into manageable pieces is crucial not only to tackle with projects that are in complex domains, but also to make software easily understandable for others without having to know about the rest of the system. 
* **Problem: Maintenance cost** / **Ability: Writing maintainable code** Every line of code, configuration or server will have to be supported by you or your coworkers for the rest of the projects' life. This is a huge legacy. You should keep the codebase as clear as possible and employ techniques that help you keep maintenance costs manageable. Embrace collective code ownership, code reviews, testing and automatic configuration tools when appropriate. Make sure you are never the only one that knows about a part of your project. Unless you like being woken up in the middle of the night, on friday, after a party.
