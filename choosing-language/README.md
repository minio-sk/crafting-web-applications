Choosing programming language
=============================

_**Task:** Imagine you have to choose a programming language you are going to use for the next 5 years. What would you consider?_

    
_**Task:** What would your manager/boss probably consider when choosing a programming language?_


_**Task:** What would your customer probably say when asked programming language you should use for the project?_


_**Task:** How did you choose the programming language you use most of the time nowadays?_

---

Chances are that you probably picked the language you use now because of very different reasons. The most common answer we get is: **Because we learned it at school.** We do not want to argue about whether schools do pick the right programming languages for you, but at least think about if it meets the criteria you would use today.
